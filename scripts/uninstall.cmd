:: Prey Head Tracking - Uninstall
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - uninstall body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/uninstall-body.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: uninstall behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper. Everything below the
:: CONFIG BLOCK is copied verbatim from
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/uninstall-wrapper.cmd.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
