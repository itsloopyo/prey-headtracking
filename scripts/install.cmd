:: Prey Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-asi.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper. Everything below the
:: CONFIG BLOCK is copied verbatim from
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-asi.cmd.

:: Filename the ASI loader DLL is renamed to: the import the game exe already
:: has. winmm.dll, dinput8.dll, dxgi.dll and xinput1_3.dll are the common ones.
set "ASI_LOADER_NAME=dinput8.dll"
:: Subdirectory below the exe directory to deploy into, for engines that load
:: their proxy DLL from somewhere other than beside the exe. Source engine wants
:: bin\; a copy next to the exe is never loaded. Leave empty for everything
:: else, and set the same value in uninstall.cmd.
set "ASI_SUBDIR="
:: Files copied only when they are not already there, so an upgrade keeps
:: whatever the user tuned. Listing an .ini in MOD_DLLS instead puts it through
:: the unconditional copy and resets every key on every update.
set "MOD_SEED_FILES=HeadTracking.ini"
:: Version of the vendored Ultimate ASI Loader, recorded in the state file so
:: the launcher can tell which loader build it is looking at. Leave empty to
:: omit the field. Bump alongside vendor/ via `pixi run update-deps`.
set "ASI_LOADER_VERSION="
:: Post-install help text. `&echo ` starts each further line.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
