# Third-Party Notices

PreyHeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

Nothing in this repository is derived from, or redistributes any part of,
Prey.

| Component | Version | Licence | How it ships |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Ultimate ASI Loader | v9.7.2 | MIT | Bundled verbatim in the installer ZIP |
| MinHook | v1.3.4-14-gd94c64d | BSD-2-Clause | Compiled into `PreyHeadTracking.asi` |
| cameraunlock-core | 0f7a63455ddeb91677c9268e88fd35833aa77359 | MIT | Compiled into `PreyHeadTracking.asi` |
| OpenTrack | n/a | ISC | Not bundled; UDP protocol interoperability only |

## Ultimate ASI Loader

- **Version:** `v9.7.2` (commit `ab722befd52581a34449b603926cfab476e66b05`)
- **License:** `MIT`
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader
- **Usage:** Loads `PreyHeadTracking.asi` into Prey as `dinput8.dll`.
- **Bundled:** yes. Bundled in the release ZIP as the install-time source; the
  installer extracts the vendored copy and never fetches a loader from the
  network.

Vendored at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/`, shipped in the installer ZIP and used as the
install-time source. Taken from the upstream release asset untouched; the
upstream licence file ships beside it at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/LICENSE`.

- SHA-256: `22fda9c71eaae02460f311bf3441638340ab591586d78f1de213c4819dcb883c`

## MinHook

- **Version:** `v1.3.4-14-gd94c64d` (commit `d94c64d32ea37bc4f5ee47d580709f70c6fb6080`)
- **License:** `BSD-2-Clause`
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- **Usage:** Installs the inline hooks the camera and HUD detours are built on.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into `PreyHeadTracking.asi`, which ships in the
  release ZIP.

Git submodule at `extern/minhook/`, pinned to the commit above and compiled into
`PreyHeadTracking.asi`. The pinned commit is the authoritative record of exactly
what is built.

MinHook carries two copyright holders: Tsuda Kageyu for MinHook itself, and
Vyacheslav Patkov for the Hacker Disassembler Engine that `src/hde/` is built
from. Both notices appear below exactly as upstream ships them.

## OpenTrack

- **Version:** n/a (wire format only, no pinned release)
- **License:** `ISC`
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack
- **Usage:** We implement its UDP pose datagram layout so OpenTrack and
  compatible trackers can drive the mod.
- **Bundled:** no. No OpenTrack code is bundled or linked.

Not bundled and not linked. This mod implements the OpenTrack UDP pose datagram
layout so that OpenTrack (https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack, ISC licence)
and compatible trackers can drive it. No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries
are copied, linked or redistributed, so its licence triggers no notice
obligation here. It is credited because the wire format is its work.

## Prey

Prey and all related names, logos, characters and marks are trademarks of
their respective owners. They are used here only to identify the game this mod
applies to, which is nominative use and not a claim of any right in them. This
project is an unofficial, fan-made modification. It is not affiliated with,
endorsed by, or sponsored by the game's developers, its publishers, its engine
vendor, or any other rights holder. It redistributes no game code, no game
assets and no proprietary DLLs, and it requires a legitimately purchased copy
of the game. Any engine structure offsets, function addresses or byte patterns
referenced in the source were derived by the authors through independent
analysis of a legitimately owned copy. They are factual measurements recorded
as numbers; no decompiled or disassembled game code is stored in this
repository.
